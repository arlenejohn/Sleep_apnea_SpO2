Code for Model1 and pruned models in the article is shared in the jupyter noebook sleep_apnea_spo2.ipynb. Code for binarized model Model3 shared in jupyter notebook Binary_spo2.ipynb. Binary_spo2.ipynb uses the binarized layer implementations from https://github.com/DingKe/nn_playground/tree/master/binarynet
