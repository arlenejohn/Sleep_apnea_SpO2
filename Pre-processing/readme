timing_apnea contains the apnea start and stop time in seconds for each record and event.
loading.m extracts the ecg signals and spo2 signals from the raw data, as well as create a second by second label for apnea events.
splitting_datasets normalized the signal record, windows the signals, and split them into training, validation and test set. Minority upsampling is carried out on the training and validation set. Here the splitting is only shown for ECG signals and SpO2 signals, but for fusion algorithms, the splitting should be done for all the sensors together.
